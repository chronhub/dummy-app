## Directory Structure for DDD Application

In a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) application, the directory structure is often organized around the core concepts of DDD, which include the domain layer, application layer, infrastructure layer, and sometimes a presentation layer. Below is a common directory structure for a DDD application:

```  
/src  
  Domain 
  	 /Model  
       - Entity1.php  
       - Entity2.php  
	 /Repository  
       - Entity1Repository.php  
       - Entity2Repository.php  
	 /Service  
       - DomainService1.php  
       - DomainService2.php  

  Application  
     /Command  
       - Command1.php  
       - Command2.php  
     /Query  
       - Query1.php  
       - Query2.php  
     /Handler  
	  - CommandHandler1.php  
	  - CommandHandler2.php  
      - QueryHandler1.php  
      - QueryHandler2.php  
    /Service  
      - ApplicationService1.php  
      - ApplicationService2.php  
    /DTO  
      - DataTransferObject1.php  
      - DataTransferObject2.php  

  Infrastructure 
    /Persistence  
    /Doctrine  
      - Entity1RepositoryDoctrine.php  
      - Entity2RepositoryDoctrine.php  
    /Messaging  
        /Queue  
            - QueueService.php  
        /Web  
           /Controller  
              - ApiController.php  
           /EventListener  
              - EventListener1.php  
              - EventListener2.php  
 /Presentation  
    /Web  
       /Controller  
          - WebController1.php  
          - WebController2.php  
  /Tests  
```  

### Explanation of Directories:

- **Domain**: Contains the domain model, repositories, and services.
    - **Model**: Defines the domain entities.
    - **Repository**: Contains interfaces for repositories.
    - **Service**: Holds domain services.

- **Application**: Houses application services and data transfer objects (DTOs).
    - **Service**: Application services that orchestrate actions across the domain.
    - **DTO**: Data Transfer Objects used to transfer data between layers.

- **Infrastructure**: Contains implementations of the repositories, services, and other infrastructure-related code.
    - **Persistence**: Implementations of repositories using a specific persistence mechanism (e.g., Doctrine).
    - **Messaging**: Implementation of messaging services (e.g., message queues).
    - **Web**: Implementations related to web infrastructure (e.g., controllers).

- **Presentation**: Holds code related to user interfaces or external interfaces.
    - **Web**: Web-related code such as controllers.

- **Tests**: Unit and integration tests for the application.
    - Follows a similar structure as the source code.
