# Outbox Pattern in CQRS, DDD, and Event Sourcing

In the context of CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), DDD (Domain-Driven Design), and Event Sourcing, the **Outbox Pattern** is a technique used to ensure reliable and consistent communication between different parts of a distributed system.

## Concepts

1. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):**
- Separates the responsibilities of handling commands (write operations) and queries (read operations) in a system.

2. **DDD (Domain-Driven Design):**
- Focuses on understanding the business domain and modeling it in software.

3. **Event Sourcing:**
- The state of an application is determined by a sequence of events instead of storing the current state.

## Outbox Pattern

The Outbox Pattern is used to address the challenge of maintaining consistency between the command (write) side and the query (read) side in distributed systems.

- When a command is processed and results in a state change, an event is generated.
- The Outbox Pattern involves using an "outbox" or a dedicated table to record events that need to be published or sent to other components.
- The outbox is part of the same database transaction that processes the command, ensuring that the event and the state change are either both committed or both rolled back.
- A separate process (e.g., a background job or service) reads events from the outbox and publishes them to the event bus or other communication channels.

## Example: OrderCreatedEvent

Consider an e-commerce system with the creation of a new order:

### Command Side (Write Side):

- A `CreateOrderCommand` is received when a user places an order.
- The command handler processes the command, updates the domain model, and generates an `OrderCreatedEvent`.

CreateOrderCommand -> Command Handler -> Order Aggregate -> OrderCreatedEvent

### Event Sourcing:

- The OrderCreatedEvent is appended to the event stream for that specific order and stored in an event store.

  Event Store:  
  - Order-123: [OrderPlacedEvent, ProductAddedEvent, OrderCreatedEvent]

  Outbox Table:  
  - EventId: 98765, EventType: OrderCreatedEvent, AggregateId: Order-123


### Event Publication (Separate Process):

A background process polls the outbox table for new events.  
It reads the OrderCreatedEvent from the outbox and publishes it to an event bus or message broker.  
Other components or services subscribe to the event bus and receive notifications.

Event Bus -> OrderCreatedEvent -> Subscribers (e.g., Notification Service, Analytics Service)
